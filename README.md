# rivera_94243_project01-C_Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-with-Class

In this program I was suppost to use the same program has P01:A and P01:B but with class. In the proyect I create the tittle, the design of the game, the messages, and a restart button for the players to start the game again. Try it with two class at first and the board and design of the game works, but the problem was that the Functions of the game didn't work...

Then I try again using only 1 class and it didnt work either. I want to get better in the class theme, I have investigated ,watch videos,different pages and works and the program still doesnt work has it should do because the second part doesnt print.
